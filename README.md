LevelChat
=========

## Disclaimer

This Plugin was not made by me.
IÂ´ve only fixed it.
I will made an 4.0.0 Branch too!

## Description
A more dynamic manifold level chat plugin. This plugin doesn't interfere with plugins that uses *$player->setFormat();* and such as the sole purpose of this plugin is to only separate the chat messages made by players per level or world.

Just load the plugin and it will do the rest! No plugin configurations needed.
